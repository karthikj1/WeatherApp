Weather app for Android

Basic weather app for Android. Uses data from Weather Underground. 

My key has been removed from the public file and needs to be replaced with your personal key from Weather Underground.

Line 4 in Config.java needs a key from WeatherUnderground to access their data.
Alternately, if using the included ANT build files, set the config.apikey property in your local.properties file.

Look at http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/8a93ba8exxxxxxxx/edit.html or do a web search for Weather Underground API key for more details.
